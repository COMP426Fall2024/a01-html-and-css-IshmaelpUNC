          <p>Norse Mythology! Norse Mythology is a acollection of myths and beliefs from the North Germanic peoples, including those who lived in mordern-day Norway, Sweden, and Denmark! Central to these myths is the world tree, Yggdrasil, which connects the nine realms, including Asgard, home to the gods, and Midgard, the realm of humans. The chief god, Odin, is a wise but often mysterious figure, known for his sacrifice of an eye to gain knowledge, while his son Thor, the god of thunder, is celebrated for his strength and protection of humanity. Other important figures include Loki, a cunning trickster whose actions lead to chaos, and Frigg, Odin's wife, known for her foresight. Norse mythology also foretells the apocalyptic event known as Ragnarok, where many gods meet their doom, and the world is reborn in a cycle of destruction and renewal. These myths not only shaped the cultural and spiritual worldview of the Vikings but also continue to influence modern literature, art, and popular culture.</p>

                How do you create an accordion?
              </summary>
              <div>
                Easy! As long as you don't have to support IE11 or older browsers you could use <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> natively.

            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>
                What if I have to support IE11 or older browsers?
              </summary>
              <div>
                No worries. The fallback for these elements is quite good. They will display as open. You won't get the open/close mechanism, but you won't lose any content either.
              </div>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>
                What type of content can I have inside one of these?
              </summary>
              <div>
                Almost anything you'd like. The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element allows all <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Content_categories#flow_content" target="_blank">flow content</a>, which is basically everything.
              </div>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>
                How does it work?
              </summary>
              <div>
                The <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element encapsulates the <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> element. The <code>&lt;summary&gt;</code> becomes the 'label' for the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> and acts like a button. When clicked, the attribute <code>open</code> is added to the <code>&lt;details&gt;</code> element, making it display. You can therefore style the open and closed states seperately if you'd like.
